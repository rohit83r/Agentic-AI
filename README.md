# üß† Agentic AI Mastery

A hands-on, structured repository focused on building real-world Agentic AI systems using the latest frameworks, tools, and design patterns. This repository captures practical implementations, concepts, and experiments across the entire Agentic AI development lifecycle‚Äîfrom data ingestion and validation to multi-agent coordination and deployment.

## üöÄ What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to autonomous, goal-directed AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, executing tasks, and learning from interactions. Unlike traditional LLM apps, these systems maintain memory, communicate with tools and humans, and adapt over time. This repo explores how to build such agents using top frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Langchain, and more.

## üß© Modules Breakdown

Each folder in the repo reflects an in-depth implementation or experiment from the following topics:

### 1. **Core Agent Concepts**

* Understanding Agentic AI, Agents vs Tools, and beyond-GPT architectures.

### 2. **Pydantic (V2+)**

* Advanced schema modeling, runtime validation, decorators, and Logfire monitoring for agent observability.

### 3. **Langchain Ecosystem**

* Data ingestion pipelines, embedding models (OpenAI, HuggingFace), vector stores (FAISS, ChromaDB), and semantic search workflows.

### 4. **LCEL (Langchain Expression Language)**

* Declarative agent chains, templated prompts, tool integration, and LangServe-based API interfaces.

### 5. **LangGraph Fundamentals**

* Building agent workflows as directed graphs, with conditional routing, memory-aware decisions, and state control.

### 6. **State & Memory Management**

* Schema persistence, memory strategies (Buffer, Summary, Entity), reducers, and optimization techniques.

### 7. **LangGraph UX Enhancements**

* Streaming agents, human-in-the-loop controls, debugging, breakpoints, and rewind capabilities.

### 8. **LangGraph Deployment**

* Packaging agent apps with FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud-native CI/CD pipelines.

### 9. **Agno Framework**

* Lightweight agentic architecture optimized for RAG, web automation, and fintech assistants.

### 10. **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

* Building contextual, personalized retrieval pipelines with adaptive learning and reranking strategies.

### 11. **LangSmith**

* Visual debugging, tracing, and observability for agents and Langchain chains.

### 12. **Multi-Agent Systems with LangGraph**

* Design of autonomous teams, inter-agent communication, scalable orchestration patterns.

### 13. **CrewAI**

* Task delegation among agents, crew roles, mission flows, and Opik-based monitoring.

### 14. **LangFlow**

* Low-code visual LLM builder, flow design, prompt templates, and runtime experimentation.

### 15. **LangFlow Workflows**

* Pre-configured pipelines for common use-cases like document Q\&A, summarization, multi-hop reasoning.

### 16. **LangFlow Integrations**

* Working with SQL, CSV, MongoDB, external APIs, OpenAI/Gemini models, and third-party tools.

### 17. **n8n Automation**

* Using n8n to trigger agent tasks, automate workflows, and generate content across Notion, blogs, etc.

### 18. **AutoGen Framework**

* Complex multi-agent orchestration, feedback loops, role definition, LLM‚ÄìLLM‚Äìhuman collaboration.

### 19. **End-to-End Deployment**

* Full-stack production-ready deployment with:

  * Docker
  * GitHub Actions
  * AWS (S3, EC2, Bedrock)
  * BentoML for LLM serving and inference APIs.
