Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information.[1] With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data.[2] This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data.[2][3] For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.

RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses.[4] Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources.[1] According to Ars Technica, "RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts." This method helps reduce AI hallucinations,[4][5] which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don't exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.[6]

RAG also reduces the need to retrain LLMs with new data, saving on computational and financial costs.[1] Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include sources in their responses, so users can verify the cited sources. This provides greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.
