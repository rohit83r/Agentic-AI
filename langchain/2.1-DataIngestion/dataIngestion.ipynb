This proved the more than \\nusual sharpness of his mind.\\nHis method, which was to increase the likeness between us, \\nlay both in words and in actions; and he followed his plan very well \\nindeed. It was easy enough to have clothes like mine. He easily learned \\nto walk and move as I did.

He believed that the gray stones of his house, \\nand the small plants growing on the stones, and the decaying trees, \\nhad a power over him that made him what he was.\\nOur books — the books which, for years, had fed the sick man’s \\nmind — were, as might be supposed, of this same wild character. \\nSome of these books Usher sat and studied for hours.

How?\\n“ At first I saw no way out. It had been necessary for the neigh -\\nbors to break down the door in order to enter the room. There was no \\nother door. The opening above the fireplace is not big enough, near \\nthe top, for even a small animal. The murderers therefore must have \\nescaped through one of the windows. This may not seem possible. W e \\nmust prove that it is possible.\\n“There are two windows in the room. Both of them, you will \\nremember, are made of two parts; to open the window one must lift up \\nthe bottom half. One of these windows is easily seen; the lower part of \\nthe other is out of sight behind the big bed. I looked carefully at the \\nfirst of these windows. It was firmly closed, fastened, like the door, on \\nthe inside. T o keep the window closed, to fasten it, someone had put a \\nstrong iron nail into the wood at the side of the window in such a way \\nthat the window could not be raised. At least it seemed that the nail \\nheld the window closed. The nail was easy to see. There it was. And \\nthe people who discovered the kil l ings used their greatest strength \\nand could not raise the win  dow. I, too, tried to raise the window and \\ncould not.\\n“I went to the second window and looked behind the bed at the \\nlower half of the window. There was a nail here, too, which held the \\nwindow closed. Without moving the bed, I tried to open this window \\nalso, and again I could not do so.\\n“I did not stop looking for an answer, however, because I knew \\nthat what did not seem possible must be proved to be possible. The \\nkillers — or perhaps I should say, the killer, for I am almost certain \\nthere was only one — the killer escaped through one of these win -\\ndows. Of this I felt certain. After the murderer had left the bedroom \\nhe could have closed the win dow from the outside; but he could not \\nhave fastened it again on the inside. Y et anyone could see the nails \\nwhich held the windows tightly closed. This was the fact that stopped \\nthe police. How could the murderer put the nail back in its place?”\\n“Perhaps — perhaps if you pulled out the nail….”\\n“Y es! That is just what I thought.

Second, if it was not the nails which were holding the windows \\nclosed, then something else was holding them closed, something hard \\nto see, some thing hidden.\\n“I went back to the first window. With great effort I pulled out the \\nnail. Then I again tried to raise the window. It was still firmly closed. \\nThis did not surprise me. There had to be a hidden lock, I thought, \\ninside the window. I felt the window carefully with my fingers. Indeed, \\nI found a button which, when I pressed it, opened an inner lock. With \\nalmost no effort I raised the window.\\n“Now I knew that the killer could close the window from out -\\nside and the window would lock itself. But there was still the nail. \\nCarefully, I put the nail back into the hole from which I had taken it. \\nThen I pressed the button and tried to raise the window. I could not. \\nThe nail also was holding the window closed!”\\n“Then…then the murderer could not possibly have gone out the \\nwindow.”\\n“He could not have gone out that window. Therefore, he must \\nhave escaped through the other window. The other win dow was also \\nheld closed by a nail. But I knew I must be right. Although no one \\nelse had looked carefully at the window behind the bed, I went to it \\nand tried to see whether the two windows were in some way different. \\nThe nail in the second window looked the same as the one I had just \\nseen. I moved the bed so that I could look closely. Y es. There was a \\nbutton here, too. I was so sure I was right that without touching the \\nnail I pressed the button and tried to raise the window. Up it went!\\n“ As the window went up it carried with it the top part of the nail, \\nthe head. When I closed the window the head of the nail was again \\nin its place. It looked just as it had looked before. I took the head of \\nthe nail in my fingers and it easily came away from the window. I saw \\nthat the nail had been broken. But when I put the nail head back in \\nits place, the nail again looked whole.\\n“What seemed to be not possible we have proved to be possible. \\nThe murderer indeed escaped through that window.

As he came out he closed the window, perhaps with a pur -\\npose to do so, perhaps by chance. The special lock inside the window \\nheld the window firmly closed.

Now he \\nstopped and looked straight at me. His eyes were now hard and bright. \\nAnd I understood that using his unusual reasoning power to find the \\nanswer to those bloody murders was giving Dupin great pleasure!\\nAt first I could think only of this. Then I said: “Dupin — the \\nwindows are on the fourth floor, far above the ground. Even an open \\nwindow….”\\n“Y es. That is an interesting question: how did the mur derer go \\nfrom the window down to the ground? Once I was quite certain that \\nthe murderer had in fact gone through that window the rest was not \\nso hard to know.

There is something here that does not fit our ideas of \\nhuman actions, even when we think of men of the most terrible kind. \\nThink, also, of the great strength which was necessary to put the body \\nwhere it was found.

Also, the head of the old lady was cut almost completely from \\nthe body. Why? T o kill a woman with a knife it is not necessary to cut \\nher head off!!\\n“If, now, added to all these things, we add also the condition of \\nthe room, we have put together the following ideas: strength more \\nthan human; wildness less than human; a murder without reason; \\nhorror beyond human understanding; and a voice which made no \\nsound that men could understand.

(May 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\n\\nPrompt engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.[1]\\nA prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.[2] A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query, a command, or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, choice of words and grammar,[3] providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic.[1]\\nWhen communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\"[4] or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\".[5] Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, or emphasizing words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.[6]\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nIn 2018, researchers first proposed that all previously separate tasks in natural language processing (NLP) could be cast as a question-answering problem over a context. In addition, they trained a first single, joint, multi-task model that would answer any task-related question like \"What is the sentiment\" or \"Translate this sentence to German\" or \"Who is the president?\"[7]\\nThe AI boom saw an increase in the amount of \"prompting technique\" to get the model to output the desired outcome and avoid nonsensical output, a process characterized by trial-and-error.[8] After the release of ChatGPT in 2022, prompt engineering was soon seen as an important business skill, albeit one with an uncertain economic future.[1]\\nA repository for prompts reported that over 2,000 public prompts for around 170 datasets were available in February 2022.[9] In 2022, the chain-of-thought prompting technique was proposed by Google researchers.[10][11] In 2023, several text-to-text and text-to-image prompt databases were made publicly available.[12][13] The Personalized Image-Prompt (PIP) dataset, a generated image-text dataset that has been categorized by 3,115 users, has also been made available publicly in 2024.[14]\\n\\nText-to-text[edit]\\nMultiple distinct prompt engineering techniques have been published.\\n\\nChain-of-thought[edit]\\nSee also: Reflection (artificial intelligence)\\nAccording to Google Research, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve a problem as a series of intermediate steps before giving a final answer. In 2022, Google Brain reported that chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning ability by inducing the model to answer a multi-step problem with steps of reasoning that mimic a train of thought.[10][15] Chain-of-thought techniques were developed to help LLMs handle multi-step reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic or commonsense reasoning questions.[16][17]\\nFor example, given the question, \"Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?\", Google claims that a CoT prompt might induce the LLM to answer \"A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 9.\"[10] When applied to PaLM, a 540 billion parameter language model, according to Google, CoT prompting significantly aided the model, allowing it to perform comparably with task-specific fine-tuned models on several tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results at the time on the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark.[10] It is possible to fine-tune models on CoT reasoning datasets to enhance this capability further and stimulate better interpretability.[18][19]\\nAn example of a CoT prompting:[20]\\n\\n   Q: {question}\\n   A: Let\\'s think step by step.\\n\\nAs originally proposed by Google,[10] each CoT prompt included a few Q&A examples. This made it a few-shot prompting technique. However, according to researchers at Google and the University of Tokyo, simply appending the words \"Let\\'s think step-by-step\"[20] was also effective, which makes CoT a zero-shot prompting technique. OpenAI claims that this prompt allows for better scaling as a user no longer needs to formulate many specific CoT Q&A examples.[21]\\n\\nIn-context learning[edit]\\nIn-context learning, refers to a model\\'s ability to temporarily learn from prompts. For example, a prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the model to complete \"maison → house, chat → cat, chien →\" (the expected response being dog),[22] an approach called few-shot learning.[23]\\nIn-context learning is an emergent ability[24] of large language models. It is an emergent property of model scale, meaning that breaks[25] in downstream scaling laws occur, leading to its efficacy increasing at a different rate in larger models than in smaller models.[24][10] Unlike training and fine-tuning, which produce lasting changes, in-context learning is temporary.[26] Training models to perform in-context learning can be viewed as a form of meta-learning, or \"learning to learn\".[27]\\n\\nSelf-consistency decoding[edit]\\nSelf-consistency decoding performs several chain-of-thought rollouts, then selects the most commonly reached conclusion out of all the rollouts.[28][29]\\n\\nTree-of-thought[edit]\\nTree-of-thought prompting generalizes chain-of-thought by generating multiple lines of reasoning in parallel, with the ability to backtrack or explore other paths. It can use tree search algorithms like breadth-first, depth-first, or beam.[29][30]\\n\\nPrompting to estimate model sensitivity[edit]\\nResearch consistently demonstrates that LLMs are highly sensitive to subtle variations in prompt formatting, structure, and linguistic properties. Some studies have shown up to 76 accuracy points across formatting changes in few-shot settings.[31] Linguistic features significantly influence prompt effectiveness—such as morphology, syntax, and lexico-semantic changes—which meaningfully enhance task performance across a variety of tasks.[3][32] Clausal syntax, for example, improves consistency and reduces uncertainty in knowledge retrieval.[33] This sensitivity persists even with larger model sizes, additional few-shot examples, or instruction tuning.\\nTo address sensitivity of models and make them more robust, several methods have been proposed. FormatSpread facilitates systematic analysis by evaluating a range of plausible prompt formats, offering a more comprehensive performance interval.[31] Similarly, PromptEval estimates performance distributions across diverse prompts, enabling robust metrics such as performance quantiles and accurate evaluations under constrained budgets.[34]\\n\\nAutomatic prompt generation[edit]\\nRetrieval-augmented generation[edit]\\nMain article: Retrieval-augmented generation\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information.[35]\\nRAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases. By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining.[36]\\n\\nGraph retrieval-augmented generation[edit]\\nGraphRAG with a knowledge graph combining access patterns for unstructured, structured, and mixed data\\nGraphRAG (coined by Microsoft Research) is a technique that extends RAG with the use of a knowledge graph (usually, LLM-generated) to allow the model to connect disparate pieces of information, synthesize insights, and holistically understand summarized semantic concepts over large data collections. It was shown to be effective on datasets like the Violent Incident Information from News Articles (VIINA).[37][38]\\nEarlier work showed the effectiveness of using a knowledge graph for question answering using text-to-query generation.[39] These techniques can be combined to search across both unstructured and structured data, providing expanded context, and improved ranking.\\n\\nUsing language models to generate prompts[edit]\\nLarge language models (LLM) themselves can be used to compose prompts for large language models.[40] The automatic prompt engineer algorithm uses one LLM to beam search over prompts for another LLM:[41][42]\\n\\nThere are two LLMs. One is the target LLM, and another is the prompting LLM.\\nPrompting LLM is presented with example input-output pairs, and asked to generate instructions that could have caused a model following the instructions to generate the outputs, given the inputs.\\nEach of the generated instructions is used to prompt the target LLM, followed by each of the inputs. The log-probabilities of the outputs are computed and added. This is the score of the instruction.\\nThe highest-scored instructions are given to the prompting LLM for further variations.\\nRepeat until some stopping criteria is reached, then output the highest-scored instructions.\\nCoT examples can be generated by LLM themselves. In \"auto-CoT\", a library of questions are converted to vectors by a model such as BERT. The question vectors are clustered. Questions close to the centroid of each cluster are selected, in order to have a subset of diverse questions. An LLM does zero-shot CoT on each selected question. The question and the corresponding CoT answer are added to a dataset of demonstrations. These diverse demonstrations can then added to prompts for few-shot learning.[43]\\n\\nText-to-image[edit]\\nSee also: Artificial intelligence art §\\xa0Prompt engineering and sharing, and Artificial intelligence art\\nExample of prompt engineering for text-to-image generation, with Fooocus\\nIn 2022, text-to-image models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney were released to the public. These models take text prompts as input and use them to generate images.[44][6]\\n\\nDemonstration of the effect of negative prompts on images generated with Stable Diffusion\\nTop: no negative promptCentre: \"green trees\"Bottom: \"round stones, round rocks\"\\nPrompt formats[edit]\\nEarly text-to-image models typically don\\'t understand negation, grammar and sentence structure in the same way as large language models, and may thus require a different set of prompting techniques. The prompt \"a party with no cake\" may produce an image including a cake.[45] As an alternative, negative prompts allow a user to indicate, in a separate prompt, which terms should not appear in the resulting image.[46] Techniques such as framing the normal prompt into a sequence-to-sequence language modeling problem can be used to automatically generate an output for the negative prompt.[47]\\nA text-to-image prompt commonly includes a description of the subject of the art, the desired medium (such as digital painting or photography), style (such as hyperrealistic or pop-art), lighting (such as rim lighting or crepuscular rays), color, and texture.[48] Word order also affects the output of a text-to-image prompt. Words closer to the start of a prompt may be emphasized more heavily.[49]\\nThe Midjourney documentation encourages short, descriptive prompts: instead of \"Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils\", an effective prompt might be \"Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils\".[45]\\n\\nArtist styles[edit]\\nSome text-to-image models are capable of imitating the style of particular artists by name. For example, the phrase in the style of Greg Rutkowski has been used in Stable Diffusion and Midjourney prompts to generate images in the distinctive style of Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski.[50] Famous artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Salvador Dalí have also been used for styling and testing.[51]\\n\\nNon-text prompts[edit]\\nSome approaches augment or replace natural language text prompts with non-text input.\\n\\nTextual inversion and embeddings[edit]\\nFor text-to-image models, textual inversion performs an optimization process to create a new word embedding based on a set of example images. This embedding vector acts as a \"pseudo-word\" which can be included in a prompt to express the content or style of the examples.[52]\\n\\nImage prompting[edit]\\nIn 2023, Meta\\'s AI research released Segment Anything, a computer vision model that can perform image segmentation by prompting. As an alternative to text prompts, Segment Anything can accept bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and foreground/background points.[53]\\n\\nUsing gradient descent to search for prompts[edit]\\nIn \"prefix-tuning\",[54] \"prompt tuning\", or \"soft prompting\",[55] floating-point-valued vectors are searched directly by gradient descent to maximize the log-likelihood on outputs.\\nFormally, let \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE\\n\\n=\\n{\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n,\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {E} =\\\\{\\\\mathbf {e_{1}} ,\\\\dots ,\\\\mathbf {e_{k}} \\\\}}\\n\\n be a set of soft prompt tokens (tunable embeddings), while \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n=\\n{\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n,\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {X} =\\\\{\\\\mathbf {x_{1}} ,\\\\dots ,\\\\mathbf {x_{m}} \\\\}}\\n\\n and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nY\\n\\n=\\n{\\n\\n\\ny\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n,\\n\\n\\ny\\n\\nn\\n\\n\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Y} =\\\\{\\\\mathbf {y_{1}} ,\\\\dots ,\\\\mathbf {y_{n}} \\\\}}\\n\\n be the token embeddings of the input and output respectively. During training, the tunable embeddings, input, and output tokens are concatenated into a single sequence \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nconcat\\n\\n(\\n\\nE\\n\\n;\\n\\nX\\n\\n;\\n\\nY\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{concat}}(\\\\mathbf {E} ;\\\\mathbf {X} ;\\\\mathbf {Y} )}\\n\\n, and fed to the LLMs. The losses are computed over the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nY\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Y} }\\n\\n tokens; the gradients are backpropagated to prompt-specific parameters: in prefix-tuning, they are parameters associated with the prompt tokens at each layer; in prompt tuning, they are merely the soft tokens added to the vocabulary.[56]\\nMore formally, this is prompt tuning. Let an LLM be written as \\n\\n\\n\\nL\\nL\\nM\\n(\\nX\\n)\\n=\\nF\\n(\\nE\\n(\\nX\\n)\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle LLM(X)=F(E(X))}\\n\\n, where \\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle X}\\n\\n is a sequence of linguistic tokens, \\n\\n\\n\\nE\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle E}\\n\\n is the token-to-vector function, and \\n\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle F}\\n\\n is the rest of the model.

For prefix tuning, it is similar, but the \"prefix vector\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ\\n~\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tilde {Z}}}\\n\\n is pre-appended to the hidden states in every layer of the model.[citation needed]\\nAn earlier result uses the same idea of gradient descent search, but is designed for masked language models like BERT, and searches only over token sequences, rather than numerical vectors. Formally, it searches for \\n\\n\\n\\narg\\n\\u2061\\n\\nmax\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n~\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\nlog\\n\\u2061\\nP\\nr\\n[\\n\\nY\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n|\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n~\\n\\n\\n\\n∗\\n\\nX\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n]\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\arg \\\\max _{\\\\tilde {X}}\\\\sum _{i}\\\\log Pr[Y^{i}|{\\\\tilde {X}}\\\\ast X^{i}]}\\n\\n where \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n~\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tilde {X}}}\\n\\n is ranges over token sequences of a specified length.[57]\\n\\nLimitations[edit]\\nWhile the process of writing and refining a prompt for an LLM or generative AI shares some parallels with an iterative engineering design process, such as through discovering \\'best principles\\' to reuse and discovery through reproducible experimentation, the actual learned principles and skills depend heavily on the specific model being learned rather than being generalizable across the entire field of prompt-based generative models. Such patterns are also volatile and exhibit significantly different results from seemingly insignificant prompt changes.[58][59] According to The Wall Street Journal in 2025, the job of prompt engineer was one of the hottest in 2023, but has become obsolete due to models that better intuit user intent and to company trainings.[60]\\n\\nPrompt injection[edit]\\nMain article: Prompt injection\\nSee also: SQL injection, Cross-site scripting, and Social engineering (security)\\nPrompt injection is a cybersecurity exploit in which adversaries craft inputs that appear legitimate but are designed to cause unintended behavior in machine learning models, particularly large language models (LLMs). This attack takes advantage of the model\\'s inability to distinguish between developer-defined prompts and user inputs, allowing adversaries to bypass safeguards and influence model behaviour. While LLMs are designed to follow trusted instructions, they can be manipulated into carrying out unintended responses through carefully crafted inputs.[61][62]\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ a b c Genkina, Dina (March 6, 2024). \"AI Prompt Engineering is Dead: Long live AI prompt engineering\".

      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}, page_content='Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Chief among these are giant elliptical galaxies found in the centers \\nof rich galaxy clusters. Numerous studies have shown that the major axes of \\nthese galaxies often share the same orientation as the surrounding matter \\ndistribution on larger scales1-6. Using Hubble Space Telescope observations of 65 \\ndistant galaxy clusters, we show for the first time that similar alignments are seen \\nat earlier epochs when the universe was only one-third its current age. These \\nresults suggest that the brightest galaxies in clusters are the product of a special \\nformation history, one influenced by development of the cosmic web over billions \\nof years. \\n \\nThe most massive galaxies in the universe appear to know about their \\nsurroundings. It is well established that the major axes of brightest cluster galaxies \\n(hereafter BCGs) are often elongated in the same direction as the galaxy cluster in \\nwhich they reside and, furthermore, that clusters themselves are aligned with their \\nneighbors, a remarkable coherence of structures over many millions of light years. With \\n \\n2\\nfew exceptions7-10, however, most studies of BCG alignments have focused on relatively \\nnearby systems at redshifts z < 0.1. Examining more distant clusters can provide a \\nglimpse into how these alignments have evolved over time, yielding insights into the \\nprocesses that have shaped galaxies over the history of the universe. \\nWith this motivation, we assembled a sample of 65 distant galaxy clusters with \\ndeep multi-color images available from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive. \\nThese clusters, which are listed in Table 1, were discovered using a variety of \\ntechniques including optical and near-infrared imaging, x-ray detection, and the \\nSunyaev-Zel’dovich effect11-16. A few examples are shown in Figure 1. Although \\nincomplete, this sample provides a representative selection of the most massive galaxy \\nclusters at redshifts 0.19 < z < 1.8, corresponding to look-back times ranging from two \\nto ten billion years.  \\nBecause most galaxies in these HST fields lack spectroscopic redshifts, likely \\ncluster members were identified based on their location along the ‘red sequence,’ a \\nwell-defined region in color-magnitude space occupied by passively evolving early-type \\ngalaxies. The number of red sequence galaxies detected ranges from more than one \\nhundred in the richest low-redshift clusters in our sample to a dozen or so in the most \\ndistant clusters. Each galaxy’s shape and orientation in the plane of the sky was \\nmeasured from rest frame r-band HST images (for z < 1) or Y and JH images (for z > 1) \\nby fitting a single-component Sérsic profile to the observed brightness distribution using \\nthe GALFIT software package (see Methods for more details).  \\nThe orientation of each cluster’s principal axis was determined by computing the \\nmoments of inertia of the distribution of red sequence galaxies (see Methods for \\ndetails), which are reliable tracers of the cluster mass distribution17. Cluster position \\nangles are given in Table 1, along with 1σ uncertainties derived from bootstrap \\nresampling, which are typically 10° to 20°. Thirteen clusters whose position angles were \\nfound to be uncertain by more than 25° were culled from the sample, leaving 52 clusters \\nfor subsequent analysis. Cluster orientations obtained from moments of inertia were \\nfound to be in good agreement with other independent determinations18. As a further \\ncheck, for the clusters in the CLASH12 sample with published mass models derived from \\n \\n3\\ngravitational lensing analysis we measured each cluster’s principal axis and its \\norientation by fitting ellipses to the inferred mass distribution. The agreement is \\nexcellent in general, with a median difference of only 11° between the position angles \\nobtained from moments of inertia versus gravitational lensing (see Methods for more \\ndetails). \\nWe first examine the general tendency for cluster galaxies of all luminosities to \\nbe aligned. Orientations were measured for 2137 individual galaxies in 22 CLASH \\nclusters, reaching ~ 3-4 magnitudes fainter than the brightest member. We did not \\ninclude all clusters for economy of effort, as the CLASH clusters are a homogeneous \\nsample and contain most of the red sequence galaxies considered in this study.  The \\nacute angle, θ, between the position angle of each galaxy’s major axis and that of its \\nhost cluster was computed and the results are shown in Figure 2. The uniform \\ndistribution between 0° and 90° is consistent with random orientations of galaxies in \\nthese clusters. This is confirmed by three different statistical tests for isotropy: Kuiper’s \\nV statistic, Rao’s spacing test and the binomial test (see Methods for more details). \\nHowever, a very strong alignment tendency is seen when only the brightest \\nmember of each cluster is considered (Figure 3). The probability that the BCGs have \\nrandom orientations with respect to their host clusters is very small, with p = 0.000141, \\n0.000016 and 0.0152 according to the binomial, Kuiper V and Rao spacing tests, \\nrespectively. The second brightest and fainter galaxies show no significant alignment \\ntendency, as is seen at lower redshifts19,20. Likewise, no correlation was found between \\nalignments and a galaxy’s absolute magnitude, surface brightness distribution as \\nmeasured by Sersic index, ellipticity, nor on the magnitude difference between the first \\nand second brightest cluster members. The primary factor that appears to determine \\nwhether a galaxy is aligned with its host cluster is that it must be the brightest cluster \\nmember, which suggests that there is something special about the birth and evolution of \\nthose galaxies. Other studies likewise support the view of BCGs as distinct from other \\ncluster galaxies rather than just the statistical extreme of a single population21-23, with \\nalignments yet another piece of evidence that they are the product of a unique formation \\nhistory. \\n \\n4\\nFigure 4 shows the relative orientations of the brightest member galaxies with \\nrespect to their host clusters for the ten most distant clusters in our sample, all at z > \\n1.3. Despite the small sample size, there is clear evidence of BCG alignments at these \\nepochs. The binomial test shows that the distribution seen in Figure 4 has a probability \\np = 0.044 of being consistent with random orientations, while the Kuiper V and Rao \\nspacing tests indicate likelihoods of only p = 0.019 and p = 0.051, respectively.  We \\nconclude that the brightest galaxies in clusters have been aligned with their \\nsurroundings for at least the past ten billion years.  \\nWe emphasize that the alignments seen in Figure 3 and 4 are physical rather \\nthan a result of systematic errors. Cosmic shear is not expected to produce a false \\nsignal of intrinsic alignments within clusters, and any systematic errors that might arise \\nin measuring galaxy orientations should not correlate with the distribution of galaxies on \\nlarger scales. In fact, given the uncertainties in the measured galaxy and cluster \\norientations, the intrinsic alignments of BCGs with their host clusters must be even \\nstronger than seen in the figures. We note that the lack of alignments for non-BCGs is \\nnot an artifact of greater uncertainties in the position angles of fainter galaxies, because \\nin many clusters the BCG and second-ranked member differ by only a few tenths of a \\nmagnitude in apparent brightness, and faint members of nearby clusters can appear \\nbrighter than the most luminous members of distant clusters. \\nThere are several plausible theories for the origin of BCG alignments24-26. The \\nmost likely mechanisms are (a) anisotropic infall of matter into clusters along preferred \\ndirections (i.e., filaments) as seen in cosmological dark matter simulations, (b) \\nprimordial alignment with the surrounding matter distribution at the time of galaxy \\nformation, (c) gravitational torques that gradually align galaxies with the local tidal field \\nor (d) some hybrid of these. The results presented here do not allow us to differentiate \\nbetween these scenarios except to note that the alignments must develop rapidly27, as \\nthe highest redshift BCGs in our sample already have luminosities comparable to those \\nof their low-redshift counterparts.  \\nNumerical simulations could shed some light on the origin of BCG alignments. A \\ngrowing number of studies have examined the expected alignment of galaxy- and \\n \\n5\\ncluster-size halos in the standard ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) cosmology, usually \\nin the context of estimating the potential contamination of weak lensing measurements \\nby intrinsic galaxy alignments28-32. Few, however, have specifically addressed the \\nquestion of BCG alignments.  \\nBecause BCGs usually reside at or near the cluster center, this suggests that \\ntheir alignment may be related to their special location. Indeed, it has been suggested \\nthat these galaxies could be viewed as ‘proto-nuclei’ of clusters33. Further study of BCG \\nalignments at even higher redshifts could provide additional insights into the processes \\nand timescales that have influenced the formation and evolution of these galaxies, the \\nmost massive in the universe, over billions of years.  \\n \\n \\n \\n6\\nTable 1.

As in Figure 2, θ is the acute angle \\nbetween the major axis of the brightest cluster galaxy and that of the cluster in which it \\nresides.

Galaxy alignments at the highest redshifts. The orientations of the brightest \\nmember galaxies with respect to their host clusters in the ten clusters at redshifts z > \\n1.3. A statistically significant tendency for these galaxies and their host clusters to share \\nsimilar orientations is found even at early epochs. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17\\nMethods \\n \\nIdentifying cluster galaxies from the red sequence \\nWe used the red sequence to select cluster members in the same fashion as \\nprevious studies34,35. This is based on the tight correlation between color and luminosity \\nfor elliptical galaxies, which are the dominant population in clusters. We fit a straight line \\nto the red sequence using the method of minimum absolute deviation to exclude \\npossible outliers. Galaxies within 5σ of the red sequence scatter (±0.25 mag) were \\nassumed to be cluster members. For two clusters in the CLASH sample where \\nspectroscopic information has been published, this yields a fidelity rate great than 95%, \\nalthough contamination may increase towards higher redshifts and for fainter galaxies35. \\n \\nPosition angle measurements and uncertainties \\nCluster position angles were derived from the projected distribution of member \\ngalaxies on the plane of the sky. This was done by computing the moments of inertia of \\nthe galaxy distribution with respect to the cluster center, which is assumed to coincide \\nwith the location of the brightest member galaxy.  Position angle uncertainties were \\nestimated by generating 100,000 bootstrap resamples of the member galaxies in each \\ncluster. The 1σ uncertainties are given in Table 1 and are typically 10° to 20°. Clusters \\nwhose position angle uncertainty exceeds 25° were culled from the sample. \\nAs an additional check, for CLASH clusters with published mass models derived \\nfrom gravitational lensing analysis36, we measured each cluster’s principal axis and its \\norientation by fitting ellipses at a projected distance of 500 kpc from the cluster center \\nusing the ellipse task in the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) package. The \\nmedian difference between these two independent measures of cluster position angles \\nwas found to be 11°, consistent with the aforementioned uncertainties. \\nIndividual galaxy orientations were determined using GALFIT37,38. Briefly, \\nGALFIT is a data analysis package that fits two-dimensional analytic functions to the \\nsurface brightness distribution in extended objects like galaxies. Models are convolved \\n \\n18\\nwith the image point spread function (PSF) to properly account for the effects of seeing \\non the derived galaxy structural properties. The PSF is measured empirically from stars \\nin each image, which automatically takes into account the effects of image processing \\n(e.g., drizzling). We note that most of the galaxies in these HST images are \\nsubstantially larger than the PSF.  \\nGALFIT deblends overlapping galaxies and can fit any number of components \\nsimultaneously. Because clusters are dominated by elliptical galaxies, we adopt a \\nsingle-component Sérsic profile to describe their surface brightness distributions. The \\nSérsic profile has several adjustable parameters: an index that characterizes the degree \\nof central concentration, luminosity, centroid, axial ratio, half-light radius, position angle \\nand deviations from an ellipsoidal shape. In general, GALFIT is quite robust and \\ninsensitive to input parameters, yielding typical uncertainties of less than 5° for the \\nmajor axis position angles of most galaxies. Further details of how GALFIT works can \\nbe found in the original papers. \\n \\nStatistical assessment of galaxy alignments  \\nDetermining whether galaxies have preferred orientations with respect to their \\nhost cluster requires statistical analysis.  We employ three well-established statistical \\ntests to assess the significance of the results shown in Figures 2-4. \\nThe Rao Spacing Test39 ascertains whether directional data are isotropic. It is a \\nnon-parametric test and requires no binning of data. The basic idea is simple: if galaxies \\nhave random orientations then the acute angle, θ, between a galaxy’s major axis and \\nthat of the cluster in which it resides should be uniformly distributed between 0° and 90° \\nand approximately evenly spaced 90°/N degrees apart, where N is the number of \\ngalaxies in the sample. Large deviations from uniform spacing indicate data that are \\nclustered or anti-clustered, as is expected if galaxies have non-random orientations. \\nThe test was implemented by sorting the angles θ and then calculating the sum, U, of \\ndeviations between adjacent values, \\n  \\n𝐔=\\n𝟏\\n𝟐 \\n|𝐓𝐢\\n𝐍\\n𝐢*𝟏\\n –  𝛌| \\n \\n19\\nwhere \\n \\n𝛌= \\n𝟗𝟎°\\n𝐍 \\nand  \\n \\n𝐓𝐢= 𝛉𝐢1𝟏− 𝛉𝐢 for 𝐢 ≤𝐍−𝟏,  𝐓𝐢= 𝟗𝟎° − 𝛉𝐍+ 𝛉𝟏  for i = N. \\nThe statistical significance of the observed value of U for a sample is found by \\ngenerating a million Monte Carlo realizations in which N angles are randomly drawn \\nbetween 0° and 90° and recording how often the value of U found for the random \\nrealizations exceeds that of the real data. \\nKuiper’s V statistic40 provides a second measure of the significance of galaxy \\nalignments. The statistic, which is a refinement of the well-known Kolmogorov-Smirnov \\ntest, is defined as \\n \\n𝐕= 𝐃1 + 𝐃7 \\nwhere D+ and D− are the maximum deviations above and below the cumulative \\ndistribution function of the observed values of θ compared to the expected cumulative \\ndistribution for random galaxy orientations. The null hypothesis of isotropy is rejected for \\nlarge values of V. Like Rao’s Spacing Test, Kuiper’s test is non-parametric and free of \\nbinning. As before, the statistical significance of V values found for the data shown in \\nFigures 2-4 was determined by generating Monte Carlo realizations of N randomly \\nchosen values of θ between 0° and 90° and recording the frequency with which V for \\nthe random samples exceeded that of the real data. \\nThe binomial test provides a third statistical assessment that is useful for small \\nsample sizes.  Like a simple coin toss in which there are two possible outcomes, we \\ncompare the number of times that θ, which ranges from 0° to 90°, is less than or greater \\nthan 45°. The binomial distribution then yields the probability of the observed numbers \\noccurring if galaxy orientations are isotropic, \\n𝒑𝒙= \\n𝑵!\\n𝒙! 𝑵−𝒙! 𝟎. 𝟓𝒙 𝟎. 𝟓𝑵7𝒙 \\n \\n20\\nwhere N is the total number of angles θ and x is the number of times that θ is less than \\n(or greater than) 45°. \\n \\nAcknowledgments: The authors are indebted to Cristóbal Sifón for insightful \\ncomments and recommendations that strengthened our results and their presentation. \\nThis work is based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space \\nTelescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute. \\nSTScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. \\nunder NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

Examples include software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nThe first example of an algorithmically generated media is likely the Markov chain. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\nComputers were needed to go beyond Markov chains. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural networks (2014–2019) ===\\n\\nSince inception, the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress, and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling.\\nIn 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images.\\nIn 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older Long-Short Term Memory models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1, in 2018. This was followed in 2019 by GPT-2, which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a Foundation model.\\nThe new generative models i'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Generative AI pornography', 'summary': 'Generative AI pornography or simply AI pornography is a digitally created pornography produced through generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

Unlike traditional pornography, which involves real actors and cameras, this content is synthesized entirely by AI algorithms. These algorithms, including Generative adversarial network (GANs) and text-to-image models, generate lifelike images, videos, or animations from textual descriptions or datasets.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AI Undress) ===\\nSeveral US states are taking actions against using deepfake apps and sharing them on the internet. In 2024, San Francisco filed a landmark lawsuit to shut down \"undress\" apps that allow users to generate non-consensual AI nude images, citing violations of state laws. The case aligns with California\\'s recent legislation—SB 926, SB 942, and SB 981—championed by Senators Aisha Wahab a'), Document(metadata={'title': 'AI boom', 'summary': 'The AI boom is an ongoing period of rapid progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that started in the late 2010s before gaining international prominence in the 2020s.

This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring, to contrast it with previous AI winters.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nIn 2012, a University of Toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower the error rate below 25% for the first time during the ImageNet challenge for object recognition in computer vision. The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade, when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to significant increase in public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphics processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. \\nIn 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently.\\nThe release of ChatGPT in November 2022, a chatbot based on a large language model created by OpenAI, accelerated the pace of AI boom. ChatGPT had over 100 million users in two months, and according to investiment bank UBS, was the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. Several other companies have released competitors. At a similar time, text-to-image-models such as DALL-E and Midjourney become popular as a way to generate complicated photo-like illustrations. Speech synthesis software also became able to replicate the voices and speech of specific people.\\nAccording to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in AI. Scientists who have immigrated to the U.S. play an outsized role in the country\\'s development of AI technology. Many of them were educated in China, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries.\\nIn 2021, an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations outlined ways that the U.S. could maintain its position amid progress made by China. In 2023, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated for the U.S. to use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements.\\n\\n\\n== Advances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biomedical ===\\nThe AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP\\'s global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\", adding that \"It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted.\"\\nThe ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases.\\n\\n\\n=== Images and videos ===\\n\\nText-to-image models captured widespread public attention when OpenAI announced DALL-E, a transformer syst')]\n"
