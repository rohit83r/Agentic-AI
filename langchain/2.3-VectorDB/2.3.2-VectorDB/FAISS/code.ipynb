This was a large and beautiful stone building he \\nhad planned himself. A strong, high wall circled it. This wall had gates  \\nof iron. The gentlemen, after they had entered, brought fire to heat \\nthe iron of the gates to make them close so firmly that nobody could \\nopen them. Here they could forget the sickness, the Red Death.

It was in a large house about three \\nhundred years old, in a small town in England, among a great number \\nof big trees. All of the houses there were very old.

It was then and there \\nthat I first saw, hanging over me, the terrible promise of things to \\ncome. Let me remember.\\nThe house where we boys lived and went to school was, as I have \\nsaid, old and wide. The grounds about it were large, and there was a \\nhigh wall around the outside of the whole school. Beyond this wall we \\nwent three times in each week, on one day to take short walks in the \\nneighboring fields, and two times on Sunday to go to church.

I was wild with hate and anger; in \\nmy arm I felt the strength of a thousand men. In a few moments I had \\nforced him back against the wall, and he was in my power.

Its owner was named Roderick Usher. W e had \\nbeen friends when we were boys; but many years had passed since our \\nlast meeting. A letter from him had reached me, a wild letter which \\ndemanded that I reply by coming to see him. He wrote of an illness of \\nthe body — of a sickness of the mind — and of a desire to see me — \\nhis best and indeed his only friend. It was the manner in which all this \\nwas said — it was the heart in it — which did not allow me to say no.\\nAlthough as boys we had been together, I really knew little about \\nmy friend. I knew, however, that his family, a very old one, had long \\nbeen famous for its understanding of all the arts and for many quiet \\nacts of kindness  to the poor. I had learned too that the family had \\nnever been a large one, with many branches. The name had passed \\nalways from father to son, and when people spoke of the “House of \\nUsher,” they included both the family and the family home.\\nI again looked up from the picture of the house reflected in the \\nlake to the house itself. A strange idea grew in my mind — an idea so \\nstrange that I tell it only to show the force of the feelings which laid \\ntheir weight on me. I really believed that around the whole house, \\nand the ground around it, the air itself was different. It was not the air \\nof heaven. It rose from the dead, decaying trees, from the gray walls, \\nand the quiet lake. It was a sickly, unhealthy air that I could see, \\nslow-moving, heavy, and gray.\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I looked \\nmore carefully at the building itself. The most noticeable thing about \\nit seemed to be its great age. None of the walls had fallen, yet the \\nstones appeared to be in a condi tion of advanced decay. Perhaps the \\ncareful eye would have discovered the beginning of a break in the \\nfront of the build ing, a crack making its way from the top down the \\nwall until it became lost in the dark waters of the lake.\\nI rode over a short bridge to the house. A man who worked in the \\nhouse — a servant — took my horse, and I entered. Another servant, \\nof quiet step, led me without a word through many dark turnings to \\nthe room of his master.

The windows were \\nhigh, and pointed at the top, and so far above the black floor that they \\nwere quite out of reach. Only a little light, red in color, made its way \\nthrough the glass, and served to lighten the nearer and larger objects. \\nMy eyes, however, tried and failed to see into the far, high corners of \\nthe room. Dark coverings hung upon the walls. The many chairs and \\ntables had been used for a long, long time. Books lay around the room, \\nbut could give it no sense of life. I felt sadness hanging over every -\\nthing. No escape from this deep cold gloom seemed possible.\\nAs I entered the room, Usher stood up from where he had been \\nlying and met me with a warmth which at first I could not believe was \\nreal. A look, however, at his face told me that every word he spoke \\nwas true.\\nW e sat down; and for some moments, while he said nothing, I \\nlooked at him with a feeling of sad surprise. Surely, no man had ever \\nbefore changed as Roderick Usher had! Could this be the friend of my \\nearly years? It is true that his face had always been unusual. He had \\ngray-white skin; eyes large and full of light; lips not bright in color, \\nbut of a beauti  ful shape; a well-shaped nose; hair of great softness \\n— a face that was not easy to forget. And now the increase in this \\nstrangeness of his face had caused so great a change that I almost did \\nnot know him. The horrible white of his skin, and the strange light \\nin his eyes, surprised me and even made me afraid. His hair had been \\nallowed to grow, and in its softness it did not fall around his face but \\nseemed to lie upon the air. I could not, even with an effort, see in my \\nfriend the appearance of a simple human being.\\nIn his manner, I saw at once, changes came and went; and I \\nsoon found that this resulted from his attempt to quiet a very great \\nnervousness. I had indeed been prepared for some thing like this, \\npartly by his letter and partly by remembering him as a boy. His actions \\nwere first too quick and then too quiet.

But the wild beauty of \\nhis playing could not be explained.\\nThe words of one of his songs, called “The Haunted Palace,” I \\nhave easily remembered. In it I thought I saw, and for the first time, \\nthat Usher knew very well that his mind was weakening. This song \\ntold of a great house where a king lived — a palace — in a green \\nvalley, where all was light and color and beauty, and the air was sweet. \\nIn the palace were two bright windows through which people in that \\nhappy valley could hear music and could see smiling ghosts — spirits \\n— moving around the king. The palace door was of the richest mate -\\nrials, in red and white; through it came other spirits whose only duty \\nwas to sing in their beautiful voices about how wise their king was.\\nBut a dark change came, the song continued, and now those who \\nenter the valley see through the windows, in a red light, shapes that \\nmove to broken music; while through the door, now colorless, a ghast -\\nly river of ghosts, laughing but no longer smiling, rushes out forever.\\nOur talk of this song led to another strange idea in Usher’s mind. \\nHe believed that plants could feel and think, and not only plants, but \\nrocks and water as well. He believed that the gray stones of his house, \\nand the small plants growing on the stones, and the decaying trees, \\nhad a power over him that made him what he was.\\nOur books — the books which, for years, had fed the sick man’s \\nmind — were, as might be supposed, of this same wild character. \\nSome of these books Usher sat and studied for hours.

The opening above the fireplace is not big enough, near \\nthe top, for even a small animal. The murderers therefore must have \\nescaped through one of the windows. This may not seem possible. W e \\nmust prove that it is possible.\\n“There are two windows in the room. Both of them, you will \\nremember, are made of two parts; to open the window one must lift up \\nthe bottom half. One of these windows is easily seen; the lower part of \\nthe other is out of sight behind the big bed. I looked carefully at the \\nfirst of these windows. It was firmly closed, fastened, like the door, on \\nthe inside. T o keep the window closed, to fasten it, someone had put a \\nstrong iron nail into the wood at the side of the window in such a way \\nthat the window could not be raised. At least it seemed that the nail \\nheld the window closed. The nail was easy to see. There it was. And \\nthe people who discovered the kil l ings used their greatest strength \\nand could not raise the win  dow.

Without moving the bed, I tried to open this window \\nalso, and again I could not do so.\\n“I did not stop looking for an answer, however, because I knew \\nthat what did not seem possible must be proved to be possible. The \\nkillers — or perhaps I should say, the killer, for I am almost certain \\nthere was only one — the killer escaped through one of these win -\\ndows. Of this I felt certain. After the murderer had left the bedroom \\nhe could have closed the win dow from the outside; but he could not \\nhave fastened it again on the inside.

Second, if it was not the nails which were holding the windows \\nclosed, then something else was holding them closed, something hard \\nto see, some thing hidden.\\n“I went back to the first window.

With \\nalmost no effort I raised the window.\\n“Now I knew that the killer could close the window from out -\\nside and the window would lock itself. But there was still the nail. \\nCarefully, I put the nail back into the hole from which I had taken it. \\nThen I pressed the button and tried to raise the window. I could not. \\nThe nail also was holding the window closed!”\\n“Then…then the murderer could not possibly have gone out the \\nwindow.”\\n“He could not have gone out that window. Therefore, he must \\nhave escaped through the other window. The other win dow was also \\nheld closed by a nail. But I knew I must be right. Although no one \\nelse had looked carefully at the window behind the bed, I went to it \\nand tried to see whether the two windows were in some way different. \\nThe nail in the second window looked the same as the one I had just \\nseen.

W e \\ncame finally to the bottom of the steps and stood there a moment \\ntogether. The earth which formed the floor was cold and hard. W e \\nwere entering the last resting place of the dead of the Montresor fam -\\nily. Here too we kept our finest wines, here in the cool, dark, still air \\nunder the ground.\\nFortunato’s step was not sure, because of the wine he had been \\ndrinking. He looked uncertainly around him, trying to see through \\nthe thick darkness which pushed in around us. Here our brightly burn -\\ning lights seemed weak indeed. But our eyes soon became used to the \\ndarkness. W e could see the bones of the dead lying in large piles along \\nthe walls. The stones of the walls were wet and cold.\\nFrom the long rows of bottles which were lying on the floor, \\namong the bones, I chose one which contained a very good wine. \\nSince I did not have anything to open the bottle with, I struck the \\nstone wall with it and broke off the small end. I offered the bottle to \\nFortunato.\\n“Here, Fortunato. Drink some of this fine Medoc. It will help to \\nkeep us warm. Drink!”\\n“Thank you, my friend. I drink to the dead who lie sleeping \\naround us.”\\n“ And I, Fortunato — I drink to your long life.”\\n“ Ahh! A very fine wine, indeed! But the Amontillado?”\\n“It is farther on. Come.”\\nW e walked on for some time. W e were now under the river’s bed, \\nand water fell in drops upon us from above. Deeper into the ground \\nwe went, past still more bones.\\n“Y our vaults are many, and large. There seems to be no end to \\nthem.”\\n“W e are a great family, and an old one. It is not far now. But I \\ncan see you are trembling with the cold. Come! Let us go back before \\nit is too late.”\\n“It is nothing. Let us go on.

Finally we arrived \\nat a vault in which the air was so old and heavy that our lights almost \\ndied. Against three of the walls there were piles of bones higher \\nthan our heads. From the fourth wall someone had pulled down all \\nthe bones, and they were spread all around us on the ground. In the \\nmiddle of the wall was an opening into another vault, if I can call it \\nthat — a little room about three feet wide, six or seven feet high, and \\nperhaps four feet deep. It was hardly more than a hole  in the wall.\\n“Go on,” I said. “Go in; the \\nAmontillado is in there.”\\nFortunato continued to go \\nforward, uncertainly. I fol lowed \\nhim immediately. Soon, of course, \\nhe reached the back wall. He \\nstood there a moment, facing the \\nwall, surprised and wondering. \\nIn that wall were two heavy iron \\nrings. A short chain was hanging \\nfrom one of these and a lock \\nfrom the other. Before Fortunato \\ncould guess  what was happening, \\nI closed the lock and chained him \\ntightly to the wall. I stepped back.\\n“Fortunato,” I said. “Put your hand against the wall. Y ou must \\nfeel how the water runs over it. Once more I ask you, please, will you \\nnot go back? No? If not, then I must leave you. But first I must do \\neverything I can for you.”\\n“But…But the Amontillado?”\\n“ Ah, yes, yes indeed; the Amontillado.”\\nAs I spoke these words I began to search  among the bones. \\nThrowing them to one side I found the stones which earlier I had \\ntaken down from the wall.
